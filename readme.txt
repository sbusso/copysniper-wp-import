== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= When I try to upload my file, I get the message "There was a problem importing your files. Please check the User Guide and try again." =

This is usually because the name of your zip file is not the same as the folder it contains. Please make sure they have exactly the same name.
For example, if your folder is called "my-folder", your zip file must be called "my-folder.zip".
